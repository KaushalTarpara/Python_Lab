I am a civil engineer with a degree from Dharmsinh Desai University and experience in

participating in various events and courses. I have attended the E summit 23 at IIT Bombay,

where I learned about entrepreneurship and innovation. I have also taken part in the kabbadi

event during college, where I demonstrated my teamwork and leadership skills. I am interested

in taking online courses to enhance my knowledge and skills, such as the NPTEL course on

structure analysis. I am a critical thinker who can work under pressure and adapt to different

environments. I am looking for a challenging and rewarding career in civil engineering that will

allow me to apply my expertise and creativity..
